<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Fathima K P, a passionate and curious software developer with a love for learning, building, and solving real-world problems through code.
  Currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA), I'm exploring technologies like Java, Python, and web development, while constantly leveling up my skills in programming, system design, and so on.
  When I'm not coding, I'm probably experimenting with new tools, or learning something new to become a better developer every day.
  I'm open to internship opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate with amazing teams.
